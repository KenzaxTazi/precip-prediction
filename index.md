## Welcome

The past and future distribution of precipitation in the Upper Indus Basin in the Himalayas, especially in high altitude areas, is poorly understood. This area is of crucial importance for the water security of over 268 million people. Tools to interpolate in-situ measurements or downscale coarser more biased precipitation products are not adequate. This report proposes a methodology to downscale historical and future precipitation projections with the aim of not only making more accurate predictions but also quantifying and narrowing their associated uncertainty. This project aims to create an accurate high-resolution historical precipiation product using Multi-Fidelity Deep Gaussian Processes.

### Progress update (23rd Novembre 2021)

For single locations, Multi-Fidelity Deep Gaussian Processes outperform simpler machine learning techniques as well as environmental benchmarks including Bannister et al.â€™s bias-corrected WRF (2019), APHRODITE and CRU datasets (R2=0.600). When predicting over multiple locations, the model performs less well than other established precipitation datasets (R2=0.291). The model also overcomes some typical downscaling issues such as predicting at arbitrary locations.

### Funding

This project is funded by the [AI for Environmental Risk CDT](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk) as part of my doctoral degree at the University of Cambridge. I am also receiving computing ressources through Microsoft's [AI for Earth Grant Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth-grants#primaryR7).

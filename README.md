#  Precipitation prediction

Application of probabilistic machine learning methods to predicting local precipitation over the Upper Indus Basin.

The scripts use ERA5 re-analysis data (see <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu>). You will need to create an account and a credentials file to use the API included in the code (see <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to>).

Please get in touch for the basin masks and shapefiles.
